# 30 Days of Machine Learning Fundamentals

Hello!  
This repository is part of my study routine to build a solid foundation in Machine Learning (ML).

---

## General Objective

To understand the fundamentals of Machine Learning, become familiar with its main algorithms and tools, and develop the ability to apply models to real data.

---

## General Content

- Understanding what machine learning is and its types.
- Learning the stages of the workflow in an ML project.
- Manipulating, cleaning, and preparing data for models.
- Applying supervised and unsupervised algorithms.
- Evaluating model performance with appropriate metrics.
- Implementing basic projects with real datasets.

---

## Challenge Structure

Each day includes:

- A specific topic.
- An explanation (Markdown or notebook).
- Practical code (Jupyter notebooks).
- (Sometimes) Reflections or mini-projects.

## Contributions and Follow-along
This repository is a personal project, but if you want to follow the challenge, you're welcome to do so.
You can create your own version with a fork or leave comments/suggestions in the issues. Keep in mind that I'm not an expert in this area and there are topics I know and others where I'll also be completely new. This is a study exercise based on curiosity and exploration, without pretensions of being a professional guide, but with the intention of learning consistently.
